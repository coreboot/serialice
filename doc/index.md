# SerialICE

SerialICE is a flexible, software based system software debugger. Based
on the open source processor emulator Qemu, SerialICE allows you to log
and intercept hardware accesses of your firmware and single step your
firmware with the GNU debugger. After a couple of quiet years on the
development front, it has now adopted new filtering subsystem.
